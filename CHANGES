
Changes from version 0.6

- gbm.perf, the argument named best.iter.calc has been renamed
"method" for greater simplicity

- all entries in the design matrix are now coerced to doubles
(Thanks to Bonnie Ghosh)

- now checks that all predictors are either numeric, ordinal, or
factor

- summary.gbm now reports the correct relative influence when some 
variables do not enter the model. (Thanks to Hugh Chipman)


Planned future changes
1. (2/18/2003) Add weighted median functionality to Laplace

2. (2/18/2003) Automate the fitting process, ie, selecting
shrinkage and number of iterations

3. (2/18/2003) Add overlay factor*continuous predictor plot as an
option rather than lattice plots

4. (2/18/2003) Add multinomial and ordered logistic regression
procedures
