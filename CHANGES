Changes from version 0.7

- Additional documentation about the loss functions, graphics, and
methods is now available with the package

- Fixed the initial value for the adaboost exponential loss. Prior
to version 0.8 the initial value was 0.0, now half the baseline
log-odds

- Changes in some headers and #define's to compile under gcc 3.2
(Brian Ripley)

Changes from version 0.6

- gbm.perf, the argument named best.iter.calc has been renamed
"method" for greater simplicity

- all entries in the design matrix are now coerced to doubles
(Thanks to Bonnie Ghosh)

- now checks that all predictors are either numeric, ordinal, or
factor

- summary.gbm now reports the correct relative influence when some
variables do not enter the model. (Thanks to Hugh Chipman)

- renamed several #define'd variables in buildinfo.h so they do
not conflict with standard winerror.h names.


Planned future changes

1. Add weighted median functionality to Laplace

2. Automate the fitting process, ie, selecting shrinkage and
number of iterations

3. Add overlay factor*continuous predictor plot as an option
rather than lattice plots

4. Add multinomial and ordered logistic regression procedures
