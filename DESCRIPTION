Description: An implementation of extensions to Freund and
        Schapire's AdaBoost algorithm and Friedman's gradient boosting
        machine. Includes regression methods for least squares,
        absolute loss, t-distribution loss, quantile regression,
        logistic, multinomial logistic, Poisson, Cox proportional
        hazards partial likelihood, AdaBoost exponential loss,
        Huberized hinge loss, and Learning to Rank measures
        (LambdaMart).
